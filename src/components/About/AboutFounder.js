      75 SHOTS Founder and film poet Karin Haze's work began in 2016 while in Jamaica,
      where she witnessed the submissions against anti-sodomy archaic law of 1861 being
      rejected by the judge. This experience inspired her to create 75 Shots, named after
      the 75 countries in the world, where being gay was illegal at the time.
